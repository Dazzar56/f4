# ConPTY findings, and a plan that stops fighting it

Index of everything known about the terminal, with status and the plan:
`TERMINAL_LEDGER.md`. Start there.

Everything below comes from a probe run on a real machine (10.0.19045.7663,
`tools/conptyprobe`, log in issue #425) plus two field reports. It replaces
guesswork in `TERMINAL_REFLOW.md` §2–3 with measurements, and the
measurements change the plan.

## 1. What the probe showed

Console 40 columns wide, one `echo` of 60 characters, then a resize to 100.

**The wrap point carries a hard CRLF.** ConPTY sent

    C:\2work-150>echo ABCDEFGHIJ0123456789ab<CR><LF>
    cdefghij0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ0123456789  <CR><LF>

That is a real line break at column 40, not a soft wrap. Nothing in the
stream tells a terminal that the two rows are one line. This is the regression
the 2024 ConPTY rewrite (microsoft/terminal#17510) admitted to, and it is not
theoretical: it is on a current Windows 10 build.

**`PSEUDOCONSOLE_RESIZE_QUIRK` is accepted and ignored.** `CreatePseudoConsole`
returned OK for flag `0x2`, and the bytes sent on resize were identical, to the
byte, to the run with flag `0`. The flag that Windows Terminal built its reflow
on does nothing here.

**ConPTY reflows the buffer itself and repaints the whole viewport.** On the
resize to 100 columns it sent 379 bytes: `ESC[?25l`, `ESC[H`, every row of the
screen with `ESC[K` after it, eleven `CRLF`s for a twelve-row console, then
`ESC[7;14H ESC[?25h`. And in that repaint the `echo` line came back **as one
row** — what had been three rows at 40 columns is a single row at 100. ConPTY
keeps the line whole internally and lays it out again on every resize.

Put together: the terminal on the other end of this pipe is not allowed to
know where the soft wraps are, is not allowed to keep ConPTY from repainting,
and does not need to reflow because ConPTY already has.

## 2. What this means for f4

### 2.1. Reflow on Windows: do not build it, receive it

`TERMINAL_REFLOW.md` §3 planned a Windows reflow gated on two experiments. Both
came back negative, and a third thing came back that makes them moot. The
viewport reflow is ConPTY's job and it does it. What f4 owes the user is the
*history* — the rows that scrolled off the top, which ConPTY no longer has —
and for those the soft-wrap signal is gone, so f4 cannot re-join them either.

So on Windows the visible screen reflows (ConPTY), and the scrollback does not.
That is the ceiling on this build, and it is set by the OS, not by us. Record it
as such; do not spend more on `RESIZE_QUIRK` unless a newer build proves to
honour it (the probe will say so in one run).

There is one thing f4 can still do for the scrollback, and it is cheap: when
ConPTY's repaint delivers the rows of the *current* screen re-joined, the rows
that had scrolled into `GridHistory` before the resize are now duplicated in
spirit but not in fact — the repaint only covers the viewport. Nothing to fix,
but the log view (F3) will show old lines at their old width and new lines at
the new; that is expected and not a bug.

### 2.2. The "creep": not the repaint (a retracted hypothesis)

Field report (Windows 11, "Proc"): with panels shown, entering and leaving any
folder moves the whole terminal history up one row, seen in Ctrl+O; the startup
banner drifts off the top. A second tester (Windows 10) did not see it on his
build, then reported it started with nightly 2462a68.

An earlier version of this section blamed ConPTY's full-frame repaint: H rows
joined by H−1 CRLFs, with the last CRLF supposedly scrolling the grid when the
cursor was already on the bottom row. **That is wrong.** Feeding the probe's
exact repaint frame into the parser for every height from 3 to 14 rows pushed
zero rows into the history at every height — the last CRLF lands on row H−2
and moves the cursor to H−1, and `newline()` never runs off the end. The
hypothesis is retracted; the test written for it was deleted rather than kept
as a false guard.

What is left, by elimination: the creep tracks folder changes, and a folder
change is the one thing that types into the shell (`cd /d "…" & rem
f4_sync`), which makes cmd echo the line, print a blank line and print a new
prompt — two or three rows per folder, exactly the creep described in #165.
The stream excision erases the echoed text but not the rows. Why one tester
sees it and another does not is unexplained; 2462a68 as an onset is a clue for
whoever bisects it. See the ledger, open item O1.

### 2.3. Colour bleed on the padded rows (microsoft/terminal#75)

Related and long-known: when conhost pads a reflowed row with spaces it gives
the padding the attributes of the last non-blank character, so a colour or
underline runs to the end of the row after a resize. It is upstream and old
(2017). Not ours; noted so nobody hunts for it in f4's renderer.

## 3. The other terminals, seen again with the measurements in hand

- **Windows Terminal** — reflows because it owns conhost and can make
  `RESIZE_QUIRK` mean something. On a build where the flag is a no-op, so is
  the approach.
- **WezTerm** — per-character heuristics about whether ConPTY inserted a hard
  break (`enable_conpty_quirks`). The probe shows what those heuristics are
  fighting: at the wrap point the bytes are indistinguishable from a real
  line break. That is why it is a heuristic and why it is off by default.
- **Alacritty / xterm.js** — pad and throttle; neither recovers the soft-wrap
  signal because it cannot be recovered.
- **far2l** — no ConPTY. Its cell-level `EXPLICIT_LINE_BREAK` is set from
  cursor movement, and here the cursor movement *is* a `CRLF`, so the same
  scheme would mark ConPTY's forced wraps as hard breaks too. It has no answer
  for this either; it simply never faces it.

None of them has a trick we missed. The stream does not contain the
information.

## 4. Plan

| # | Step | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Settled-prompt completion, children, screen-at-settle (`TERMINAL_WINDOWS.md`) | shipped |
| 2 | ~~Repaint bracket~~ — retracted, the repaint does not scroll (§2.2) | dropped |
| 3 | Self-erasing directory sync cleanup | next — the sync is the remaining creep suspect |
| 4 | Stop resizing ConPTY for the keybar (§2.2 option 2) | later, for flicker |
| 5 | Windows reflow of the live grid | **dropped** — ConPTY does it; the flag is a no-op; the history cannot be re-joined |
| 6 | Re-run `tools/conptyprobe` on a Windows 11 build | when a tester has one; only a newer build can reopen step 5 |
